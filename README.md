# Performance Mapper: Final Project

### Description: 
This is the backend repo for Performance Mapper. This project was designed to enable strength and conditioning coaches to to record, monitor, and track their teams'/athletes' performance statistics and injuries, as well as visualize key trends in data across their teams and athletes. Key features are as follows:

* User Login and Homepage with horizontal bar chart of cumulative injuries across teams.

* User can view and add/delete their teams. Broken images get fixed with an automatic default image.

![View and Add Teams](README_assets/view_and_add_teams_with_default_image.gif)

* View average stats and trends of performance measures across a team, sorted by date and separated by test in individual tabs.

* View injuries across the team, data presented by site of each injury. Can click for a more detailed view of injuries (dates, descriptions, severities, etc.).

The backend of the application leverages Ruby on Rails API functionality to receive and send AJAX requests in a JSON formate. The interactive frontend is build on ReactJS, HTML, and CSS.

### Dependencies:
* Developed on Google Chrome (80.0.3987.149)
* Ruby (2.6.1)
* RAILS (6.0.2.2)
* Bundler (2.1.4)
* PostgreSQL (12.3)

### Front End Dependencies
The frontend (and backend) of this app is hosted, so, like this repo, the frontend repo is not necessary for use. However, if you'd like to run the server locally, refer to the frontend repo at https://github.com/ckaiser258/Final_Project_Frontend for instructions to set up the front-end interface and ReactJS.

### Installation:

1. Download this entire git repository to your computer and place in your desired install directory. 
2. If you don't have the above dependencies: 
   * In your terminal run `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"` to install Homebrew 
   * Then run `brew install rbenv ruby-build` to install Ruby, then `rbenv install 2.7.1` `rbenv global 2.7.1` and `ruby -v` to confirm. 
   * Finally, to install Rails, run `gem install rails -v 6.0.2.2` `rbenv rehash` and `rails -v` to confirm. 
   * If you need to install PostgreSQL, follow their instructions here: https://postgresapp.com/.
3. Via a terminal interface navigate to where you installed this repository. From this location execute ```bundle install``` to install all other required gem packages. 

### Running:

This app is hosted at https://performancemapper.netlify.app/. However, if you'd like to run the app locally, you can follow the instructions below (given you've installed the frontend repo as noted above.):

1. To start hosting the local server, start by opening PostgreSQL and starting the server. 
2. In your terminal navigate to the directory you've installed this repo in. 
3. Once there, execute `rails db:create`, `rails db:migrate`,`rails db:seed`, and finally ```rails s```. 
4. The rails server is functioning solely as a backend API for local development, so you do not need to navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser unless you'd like to test to make sure the database is running correctly. 

Note: It's recommended to run the backend on port 3000 then the front end on a different port (React will prompt you to do this).
